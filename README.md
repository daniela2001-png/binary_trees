# Binary Tree

### What is a Binary Tree?
- a data structure in which a record is linked to two successor records, usually referred to as the left branch when greater and the right when less than the previous record.
### What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree?
- A Binary Tree follows one simple rule that each parent node has no more than two child nodes, whereas a Binary Search Tree is just a variant of the binary tree which follows a relative order to how the nodes should be organized in a tree.
### What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists?
- A binary tree has a better time complexity for searching O(log N) but in the worst case can be the same as a linked list O(n). This means searching a binary tree will (in most cases) be faster than searching a linked list.
### What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree?
