# Binary Tree

### What is a Binary Tree?
- a data structure in which a record is linked to two successor records, usually referred to as the left branch when greater and the right when less than the previous record.
### What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree?
- A Binary Tree follows one simple rule that each parent node has no more than two child nodes, whereas a Binary Search Tree is just a variant of the binary tree which follows a relative order to how the nodes should be organized in a tree.
### What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists?
- A binary tree has a better time complexity for searching O(log N) but in the worst case can be the same as a linked list O(n). This means searching a binary tree will (in most cases) be faster than searching a linked list.
### What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree?

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are allowed to use the standard library
- In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called binary_trees.h
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded

## Installation

Use the package manager to install gcc.

```bash
$ sudo apt install gcc
```

## Usage

i.e.

```bash
make cero -f 0-Makefile | ./0-node
```
